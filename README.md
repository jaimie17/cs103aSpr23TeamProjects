CS103a Spring 2023 group project:
We are creating a web app using Flask which uses prompt engineering to generate useful responses to specific user queries.

Motivation: Gpt-based webapps using prompt engineering have already started to appear and this assignment is meant to help us learn how to write such apps as well as gaining experience using git for a team project. Basically it accepts some text, adds a prompt to the front, sends it to gpt, and returns the response.

Theme: "Text Generation and Analysis". 

The methods used in the GPT class generates text in various formats (summaries, translations, paraphrases, poems, articles, captions, etc.) and perform analysis on text (sentiment analysis).
