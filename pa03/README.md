# CS103a Spring 2023 group project:
We are writing SQL queries to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and aggregation(with SQLite3) to practice and devlop automated testing (with pytest). This web application will allow the user to edit, change, modify, and view their financial transactions using functions that help parse the database.

## Motivation: 
Many software projects use SQLite to manage their data and this problem set will give the experience of building such an app.  Another important process in software engineering is the design of automated tests.  This assignment will allow us to practice develoing a suite of tests for our app. There are other database and testing frameworks, but they are all similar in principle and this assignment will expose you to the core concepts and skills you'll need.
